            I always thought my dream was to be a military doctor or hotshot
            lawyer like "Harvey Specter" from "Suits". But everything changed
            since I enroll in Computer Science Major. It was a really great
            decision. Being a developer who can build something out of nothing
            is great fun, especially I can directly give worldwide impact, just
            by sitting in front of my computer.

            My current focus as an engineer is now in Typescript and Go. I've
            tried several programming language before (C, C#, C++ , Python,
            Java, PHP, etc), But decided to go with Typescript, and Go as my
            current primary arsenal.

> ## Background

Comute is a commuter application for deaf friends that has a travel route direction feature with a warning to get off the station, as well as a communication assistance feature with hearing friends which makes it easy & comfortable to use KRL transportation.

> ## My Work

- Pioneered & Implemented Jabodetabek station data into JSON, work with other 2 engineers to determine the data structure that satisfy our needs
- Pioneered & Implemented Dijkstra Algorithm in Swift to find shortest path between 2 station in Jabodetabek Train Station (google maps API doesn't match our need since it is an overkill solution at the moment)
- Implemented distance tracking between station using @Apple/CoreLocation
- Implemented client side push notification using @Apple/UserNotifications
- Implemented Animation using @Airbnb/lottie-ios

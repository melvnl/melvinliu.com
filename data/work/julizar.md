> ## Background

Julizar is a peer-to-peer crowdfunding platform focused on providing capital to Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) through a peer-to-peer system. Their platform is currently on review with Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia's independent institution that has the functions, duties, and authorities of regulation, supervision, inspection, and investigation towards all activities in the financial services sector. I was assigned with the team of 2 people, as UI/UX designer to revamp the old site.

> ## Challenge

Despite not having to design the site from scratch, I still need to reconsider the previous site user experience, since to be honest, the old site doesn't consider user experience when navigating between pages, gives ambiguous, jumbled copywriting, and inconsistency margin and typography.

> ## Solution

In order to improve the UI/UX within a short amount of time (the timeline was only 10 - 12 days) since we need to present it to OJK really soon, hence I decided to follow this fast yet powerful step:

- Surfing [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) for user interface inspiration from worldwide designers.
- Benchmarking competitor site

### Benchmarking

I did take a look at similar business UI/UX, how they provide information to the user. For instance:

- Stockbit

The new design receives a lot of positive feedback from the project owner, and from the OJK reviewer as well.
" The design emits professionalism and trustworthiness from the platform, which compulsory in the financial industry."

# Introduction

I was accepted as Bukalapak Software Engineer (Frontend) Intern in August 2021, and I was lucky enough to join Core Web Experience squad, where the engineers there are all Bukalapak first engineer who have been working

### How it start

It all start with this post in LinkedIn by kak [Dimas Pandu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimas-pandu-a04466123/), previously Talent Development Specialist at Bukalapak.

### Algorithm Test

After, a few days, I received a new email, regarding initial test through [codility](https://www.codility.com/), the test consist of 4 algorithm question, and 1 multiple choice. If only managed to score moer than 50% overall, in my opinion if you do leetcode often, the test can be considered easy.

Since I don't do well on my algorithm test, I thought my chance being an intern at Bukalapak has dissapear. Then I received a new email regarding my next step, which is an user interview with Bukalapak engineer.

### User Interview

They ask about my previous experience, my familiarity with certain tech stack, why I'm interested with Bukalapak, and there is a live coding session where I need to consume an api, and create a pagination using that api.

Fast forward after 4 days, I received an offer letter. ðŸŽ‰
